Surrounding the hourglass, include some smaller clocks—like an alarm clock, a wristwatch, and a sundial—all looking up in amazement at the hourglass. The background should be a simple gradient suggesting deep space, with subtle sparkles to emphasize a cosmic feel. The hourglass can have a small, friendly smiley face to add charm and humor, as if it''s proud to represent both ''time'' and ''eternity.''

The explorer looks determined and excited, stepping forward into a surreal, colorful landscape on the other side labeled ''Impossible.'' The impossible side can include exaggerated and imaginative elements like floating islands, upside-down trees, and glowing unusual creatures. The background should blend gradually from realistic mountains and sky on the ''possible'' side to fantastical and dreamlike scenery on the ''impossible'' side.

In the center, a quirky professor with wild hair and thick glasses stands scratching his head, holding a giant oversized question mark as if it were a physical object. Around him, floating ghostly abstract concepts and question marks without clear forms hover ambiguously. On a chalkboard behind him, scribbles and diagrams lead nowhere, with phrases like ''Undefined Ideas'' and ''Meaningless Concepts'' written messily. A faded chart titled ''Fruitful but Vague Theories'' with scattered fruit illustrations adds subtle absurdity. The overall tone is light, playful, and cartoonish with exaggerated expressions highlighting the confusion and irony about important concepts being unclear or undefinable.'),
 (2042, 'Abstract Humor, Philosophy Humor, Quotes, Science Humor', 'Life is a wave, which in no two consecutive moments of its existence is composed of the same particles.', 'John Tyndall', 'Draw a lighthearted cartoon scene showing a stylized, cheerful ocean wave on a sunny beach. The wave should be semi-transparent and sparkling, with swirls and bubbles inside to suggest it’s constantly changing. To emphasize the idea that the wave is made of different particles over time, depict numerous tiny, colorful dots or particles inside the wave, each labeled with fun, tiny faces or quirky little expressions that change from front to back or top to bottom. Above the wave, have a thought bubble with a simple, whimsical clock or hourglass icon to hint at time passing. The beach can include a smiling sun wearing sunglasses, a few seashells, and a palm tree to keep the scene lively but simple.

Around them, the setting includes typical university details: a cluttered office with bookshelves, a chalkboard with complicated formulas, a stack of papers labeled ''Committee Minutes,'' and a small trophy labeled ''Best Faculty Award.'' In the background, other professors watch worriedly or whisper to each other, some holding clipboards or academic reports. The tone is playful and exaggerated to emphasize the contrast between the fierce expressions and the trivial object or issue they fight over. The overall style is colorful and cartoonish, highlighting the irony that these supposedly serious academics are so passionately invested in something inconsequential, illustrating the punchline about university politics being vicious because the stakes are so small.'),
 (2414, 'Absurd Humor, Academic Humor, Philosophy Humor, Quotes', 'There are only two kinds of scholars; those who love ideas and those who hate them.', 'Emile Chartier', 'A humorous cartoon scene set in a cozy library or study room filled with tall bookshelves overflowing with colorful books. Two scholars are seated at a wooden table in the center. The first scholar is visibly excited, with wide eyes and a big smile, surrounded by floating lightbulbs and whimsical idea symbols like gears, stars, and question marks above their head. They are eagerly holding an open book titled ''Big Ideas.'' The second scholar, in contrast, looks annoyed and frustrated, furrowing their brow while burying their face in their hands, with crumpled papers and torn-out pages scattered around. Above them, dark scribbles and broken lightbulbs indicate their frustration or disdain for ideas. The room is warmly lit with a desk lamp and has cute details such as a steaming cup of coffee, a globe, and a quirky cat calmly watching the scene, adding charm and humor. The overall style should be lighthearted and cartoonish, emphasizing the comic contrast between loving and hating ideas without any aggression or negativity.'),

Frank Dobie', 'A humorous cartoon scene showing a scholarly-looking professor with glasses and a tweed jacket standing between two graveyards. Each graveyard has rows of simple gravestones. The professor is holding a big stack of large papers labeled ''Ph.D. Thesis.'' The professor is in the act of physically moving cartoon-style human bones—oversized femurs and skulls—from one graveyard plot to another, as if transferring them. The surrounding area is a grassy cemetery under a light blue sky with fluffy clouds. The professor has a slightly tired but amused expression, and there are a few crows watching curiously from nearby gravestones. The overall tone is light-hearted and imaginative, resembling a classic comic or editorial cartoon style with exaggerated expressions and clear, bold outlines. The scene humorously visualizes the metaphor of moving ''bones'' between graveyards to represent recycling old research without violence or negativity.'),

One friend looks calm and prepared, wearing proper hiking gear, holding a map and compass, while the other looks confused or panicked, wearing mismatched clothes and carrying a messy backpack with items spilling out. Around them are exaggerated signs of ''wrong turns'' like bent or broken signposts, a winding trail that leads off a cliff or into a swamp, and a small animal watching them curiously (like a squirrel or bird). The friend with the map looks at the other with a knowing smile, and above them is a playful caption bubble or sign that reads, "Adventure is the result of poor planning."
